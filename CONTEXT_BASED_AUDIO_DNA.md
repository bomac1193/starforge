# Context-Based Audio DNA System

## Overview

The Audio DNA system now supports **context-aware analysis** that separates your musical identity into distinct contexts:

- **DJ Collection** (`dj_collection`) - Your curatorial taste (tracks you play/mix)
- **My Music** (`my_music`) - Your creative output (tracks you produce)
- **Combined** - Full aesthetic profile across all tracks
- **Compare** - Cross-context analysis (UNIQUE FEATURE)

This creates a sophisticated, multi-dimensional understanding of your musical identity as both curator and creator.

---

## Why Context Matters

### The Multi-Hyphenate Creator Problem

Many creative professionals wear multiple hats:
- DJs who also produce
- Producers who also DJ
- Musicians who curate playlists

Traditional music analysis treats all tracks the same, but these contexts have **different meanings**:

- **Rekordbox tracks** → What you play for others (curatorial taste)
- **Uploaded tracks** → What you create yourself (artistic output)

These two contexts can be:
- **Highly aligned** (you DJ what you make)
- **Divergent** (you explore different sonic territories)
- **Complementary** (you experiment in production, curate consistently in DJ sets)

Understanding the relationship between these contexts reveals deep insights about your creative identity.

## Database Schema

### Musical Context Column

```sql
ALTER TABLE audio_tracks ADD COLUMN musical_context TEXT DEFAULT 'unknown';

-- Automatic tagging:
-- 'dj_collection' = Rekordbox imports
-- 'my_music' = File uploads
-- 'personal_library' = Future: Spotify/streaming imports
-- 'unknown' = Legacy tracks
```

### Migration

Run the migration script to add context to your existing database:

```bash
cd backend
node src/database/migrate_add_musical_context.js
```

This automatically tags existing tracks based on their source:
- Rekordbox imports → `dj_collection`
- Uploads → `my_music`

## API Endpoints

### 1. Context-Aware Sonic Palette

```http
GET /api/deep/audio/sonic-palette?context={context}
```

**Parameters:**
- `context` (optional): `dj_collection`, `my_music`, or `combined` (default: `combined`)
- `user_id` (optional): User ID (default: 1)
- `refresh` (optional): Force cache refresh (default: false)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "context": "dj_collection",
  "trackCount": 90,
  "sonicPalette": {
    "sonicPalette": [
      {
        "band": "bass",
        "bandLabel": "Bass (60-250Hz)",
        "prominence": 0.85,
        "energyDb": -8.2
      },
      // ... more frequency bands
    ],
    "tonalCharacteristics": "warm energetic bass-heavy sonic aesthetic",
    "dominantFrequencies": [...],
    "confidence": 0.92
  }
}
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Analyze DJ collection only
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/deep/audio/sonic-palette?context=dj_collection"

# Analyze personal productions only
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/deep/audio/sonic-palette?context=my_music"

# Analyze everything together
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/deep/audio/sonic-palette?context=combined"
```

---

### 2. Context-Aware Taste Coherence

```http
GET /api/deep/audio/taste-coherence?context={context}
```

**Parameters:**
- `context` (optional): `dj_collection`, `my_music`, or `combined` (default: `combined`)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "context": "dj_collection",
  "trackCount": 90,
  "coherence": {
    "overall": 0.54,
    "bpmConsistency": 0.68,
    "energyConsistency": 0.72,
    "genreCoherence": 0.45,
    "keyCoherence": 0.38,
    "moodCoherence": 0.67
  }
}
```

**Interpretation:**
- **High coherence (70%+)**: Very consistent taste/style in this context
- **Medium coherence (40-70%)**: Explores variety while maintaining identity
- **Low coherence (<40%)**: Very diverse, experimental approach

**Example:**
```bash
# Check if your DJ taste is more coherent than your productions
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/deep/audio/taste-coherence?context=dj_collection"
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/deep/audio/taste-coherence?context=my_music"
```

      "You DJ 8 BPM faster than you produce (133 vs 125).",
      "Your productions are more cohesive than your DJ sets - you explore more variety in curation."
    ]
  }
}
```

**Requires:**
- At least 1 track in `dj_collection` (Rekordbox import)
- At least 1 track in `my_music` (file upload)

## Frontend Integration

### AudioDNAPanel Context Selector

The `AudioDNAPanel` component now includes a context selector with 4 modes:

```jsx
<AudioDNAPanel
  audioData={audioData}
  rekordboxData={rekordboxData}
  clarosaData={clarosaData}
/>
```

**User Interface:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Audio DNA                                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [DJ Taste] [My Music] [Combined] [Compare]      │
│                                                 │
│ Your curatorial taste - tracks you play/mix    │
│                                                 │
│ {Context-specific analysis displays here}      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Modes:**

1. **DJ Taste** - Shows sonic palette, taste coherence for Rekordbox tracks
2. **My Music** - Shows sonic palette, taste coherence for uploaded tracks
3. **Combined** - Shows unified analysis across all tracks
4. **Compare** - Shows context comparison with insights

---

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: DJ + Producer
**Scenario:** You DJ house music but produce techno

**Analysis:**
```bash
# Check DJ collection
curl ".../sonic-palette?context=dj_collection"
# Result: House sonic signature (120-128 BPM, warm bass)

# Check productions
curl ".../sonic-palette?context=my_music"
# Result: Techno sonic signature (128-135 BPM, metallic hi-hats)

# Compare contexts
curl ".../context-comparison"
# Result: 45% alignment - you explore different sonic territories
```

**Insight:** You maintain separate creative and curatorial identities.

---

### Use Case 2: DJ Who Plays Own Music
**Scenario:** You primarily DJ your own productions

**Analysis:**
```bash
curl ".../context-comparison"
# Result: 85% alignment - you DJ what you make
```

**Insight:** Strong aesthetic coherence across curator and creator roles.

---

### Use Case 3: Experimental Producer, Conservative DJ
**Scenario:** You DJ crowd-pleasers but produce avant-garde

**Analysis:**
```bash
# DJ taste coherence
curl ".../taste-coherence?context=dj_collection"
# Result: 78% coherent (consistent curatorial taste)

# Production coherence
curl ".../taste-coherence?context=my_music"
# Result: 42% coherent (experimental, diverse output)

# Compare
curl ".../context-comparison"
# Insight: "Your DJ taste is more consistent than your productions -
#          you experiment more in the studio."
```

---

## Caching Strategy

### Context-Specific Cache Keys

Each context maintains separate cache entries:

```javascript
// Cache keys
userId_dj_collection → Sonic palette for DJ collection
userId_my_music      → Sonic palette for My Music
userId               → Sonic palette for combined view
```

**Benefits:**
- Switching contexts is instant (cached)
- Uploading new tracks only invalidates relevant cache
- Independent refresh for each context

---

## Marketing Position

## Testing the System

### 1. Current State (DJ Collection Only)

```bash
# You have 90 Rekordbox tracks
curl "localhost:5000/api/deep/audio/sonic-palette?context=dj_collection"
# ✅ Works - shows DJ taste

curl "localhost:5000/api/deep/audio/sonic-palette?context=my_music"
# ❌ 404 - "No personal music tracks. Upload your productions to analyze."

curl "localhost:5000/api/deep/audio/context-comparison"
# ❌ 404 - "No personal music tracks yet. Upload your productions to analyze."
```

### 2. After Uploading Personal Music

```bash
# Upload your productions via AudioAnalysisCompact → Upload Files tab
# Then test:

curl "localhost:5000/api/deep/audio/sonic-palette?context=my_music"
# ✅ Shows your production style

curl "localhost:5000/api/deep/audio/context-comparison"
# ✅ Shows alignment between DJ taste vs production style
```

### 3. Frontend Testing

1. Open `http://localhost:3050`
2. Go to Twin Genesis Panel → Audio Analysis
3. Click through context tabs:
   - **DJ Taste** - Shows your Rekordbox collection analysis
   - **My Music** - Prompts you to upload (or shows if uploaded)
   - **Combined** - Shows everything together
   - **Compare** - Shows comparison (once you have both contexts)

---

'soundcloud_uploads'  -- SoundCloud uploads
'bandcamp_releases'   -- Bandcamp releases
'live_recordings'     -- Live set recordings
'collaborations'      -- Collaborative tracks
```

### Context-Specific Features

- **Context Timeline**: How your DJ taste vs production style evolved over time
- **Context Influence**: Does your DJ taste influence your productions? Vice versa?
- **Context Gaps**: What's in your DJ collection but not in your productions?
- **Context Recommendations**: "Your DJ taste suggests you'd enjoy producing..."

---

## Technical Notes

### SQL Queries

```sql
-- Get DJ collection tracks
SELECT * FROM audio_tracks WHERE musical_context = 'dj_collection';

-- Get personal music tracks
SELECT * FROM audio_tracks WHERE musical_context = 'my_music';

-- Get all tracks
SELECT * FROM audio_tracks WHERE musical_context IN ('dj_collection', 'my_music');

-- Context distribution
SELECT musical_context, COUNT(*) as count
FROM audio_tracks
GROUP BY musical_context;
```

### Performance

- Context filtering is fast (indexed column recommended for large catalogs)
- Separate caching ensures switching contexts is instant
- Python analysis runs only when cache is invalid

---

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check server logs: `tmux attach -t starforge-backend`
- Verify migration ran: `SELECT musical_context, COUNT(*) FROM audio_tracks GROUP BY musical_context;`
- Test API endpoints directly with curl examples above
