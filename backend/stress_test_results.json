Their musical tastes are super interesting - they've got over 4,000 tracks in their library, and they really seem to vibe with that classic house tempo around 123 BPM. But the cool thing is, they like their music a little more contemplative and low-key, with only about 8% of that energy level. \n\nAnd the mood? Over half of it is positive and uplifting, which I can totally get behind. Their influences span a bunch of genres - other electronic stuff, some ambient/downtempo vibes, and even a little drum and bass thrown in for good measure. It's a really unique blend that gives their tunes a really cohesive, focused feel.\n\nVisually, they've got this super clean, minimalist aesthetic that complements the music perfectly. It's like they're curating this whole mood and atmosphere, you know? They're not trying to be the biggest name out there or anything, they're just doing their own thing and making music that resonates with them. And I can totally respect that. If you're into that sort of vibe, definitely check them out - I think you'll dig it.",

Melodic motifs spiral and sway, buoyed by the steady pulse of a 123 BPM heartbeat.\n\nThough the mood often skews positive and uplifting, there's an undercurrent of melancholy that lends SolarSiege's music a bittersweet quality. Ambient washes part to reveal glimpses of drum & bass-inspired rhythmic complexity, the tension and release mirroring the ebb and flow of human emotion. Shimmering pads and sustained chords create a sense of weightlessness, a sonic suspension that defies the constraints of time and space.\n\nTheir visual aesthetic is equally evocative, with album artworks depicting celestial phenomena, organic textures, and the interplay of light and shadow. Like their music, these images conjure feelings of wonder and introspection, transporting the viewer to realms beyond the mundane.
