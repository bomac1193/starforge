# Audio DNA Quick Start Guide

## What Was Implemented

**Phase 1: Core Audio DNA Features** ✅

1. **Sonic Palette Extraction** - Audio equivalent of Visual DNA color palette
   - Extracts 5 frequency bands (Bass, Low-Mid, Mid, High-Mid, Treble)
   - Generates tonal characteristics (warm/bright/dark/metallic/organic)
   - Intelligent caching for performance

2. **Taste Coherence Score** - Measures consistency of music taste
   - 6 metrics: BPM, Energy, Genre, Key, Mood, Overall
   - Statistical analysis (coefficient of variation, Shannon entropy)
   - Visualized in progress bars

3. **Cross-Modal Coherence** - UNIQUE FEATURE ⭐
   - Analyzes alignment between Visual DNA (CLAROSA) and Audio DNA
   - 3 alignment scores: Audio-Visual Match, Energy Alignment, Diversity Alignment
   - Nobody else does this - your competitive advantage

4. **Future Features Placeholders** - Roadmap visibility
   - Cultural Moment Detection
   - Influence Genealogy Map
   - Rarity Analysis
   - Scene Mapping

## How to Use

### 1. Start the Application

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd /home/sphinxy/starforge/backend
npm start

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd /home/sphinxy/starforge/frontend
npm start
```

### 2. Upload Audio Data

**Option A: Upload Files**
1. Go to Twin Genesis Panel
2. Click "Audio Analysis" section
3. Select "Upload Files" tab
4. Drag & drop MP3/WAV/M4A files
5. Click "Analyze Audio"

**Option B: Import Rekordbox**
1. Export your Rekordbox collection as XML
   - Rekordbox → File → Export Collection in xml format
2. Go to "Rekordbox" tab in Audio Analysis
3. Drag & drop `collection.xml`
4. Wait for import to complete

### 3. Connect CLAROSA (for Cross-Modal Analysis)

1. Ensure CLAROSA is running at `/home/sphinxy/clarosa`
2. In Twin Genesis Panel, click "Connect CLAROSA"
3. Visual DNA will be extracted and cached

### 4. View Audio DNA

Once you have audio data, the **Audio DNA Panel** will appear below Audio Analysis showing:

- **Sonic Palette**: Frequency bars showing dominant audio characteristics
- **Taste Coherence**: Grid of consistency metrics
- **Cross-Modal Alignment**: Alignment scores (only if CLAROSA connected)
- **Future Features**: Preview of upcoming capabilities

## Troubleshooting

### "No audio tracks available" error
- Upload tracks via Audio Analysis panel first
- Or import Rekordbox XML
- Check that tracks are being saved to `starforge_audio.db`

### Python spectral analysis fails
- Fallback to basic analysis will be used automatically
- Check Python dependencies: `python3 -c "import librosa, sklearn, numpy"`
- Check Python script permissions: `chmod +x backend/src/python/sonic_palette_analyzer.py`

### Cross-modal analysis not showing
- Ensure CLAROSA is connected first (Visual DNA required)
- Ensure audio data exists (upload tracks)
- Both Visual and Audio DNA needed for cross-modal analysis

### Cache not invalidating
- Force refresh: `POST /api/deep/audio/sonic-palette/refresh`
- Or manually delete cache: `rm backend/starforge_sonic_palette.db`

## What Makes This Unique

### Cross-Modal Coherence is Your Differentiator

**Nobody else does this:**
- Spotify: Audio features only
- Apple Music: Basic genre/mood
- Last.fm: Listening patterns only
- RYM/Discogs: Cataloging only

**You have:**
- Visual DNA from CLAROSA (photo aesthetic)
- Audio DNA from music catalog (sonic aesthetic)
- **Cross-modal analysis linking them together**

This is revolutionary for:
- Creative professionals who care about aesthetic coherence
- DJs/musicians understanding their sonic identity
- Photographers/visual artists who also make music
- Anyone with a holistic creative practice

### Marketing Position

> "Starforge Twin OS analyzes your aesthetic DNA across visual and audio dimensions, revealing how your creative tastes align across modalities. It's not just what you like—it's understanding the coherence of your entire aesthetic universe."

**Target Psychographic:**
- Elite tastemakers
- Multi-disciplinary creatives
- People who think about their "aesthetic" holistically
- Early adopters who want tools nobody else has

## Testing Checklist

Before considering it production-ready:

- [ ] Upload 10+ audio files, verify analysis works
- [ ] Import Rekordbox XML with 100+ tracks, verify parsing
- [ ] Connect CLAROSA, verify Visual DNA extraction
- [ ] View Audio DNA Panel, verify all sections display correctly
- [ ] Test with different music styles (techno, ambient, jazz, etc.)
- [ ] Verify cache works (second load should be instant)
- [ ] Test cross-modal analysis with various photo/music combos
- [ ] Verify placeholder buttons are styled correctly

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

When ready to implement future features:

### Cultural Moment Detection
- Build trend detection algorithm
- Monitor emerging sounds across user base
- Database of cultural movements with sonic signatures

### Influence Genealogy
- Genre lineage database (Detroit techno → UK garage → dubstep)
- Sonic similarity matching across eras
- Visual family tree component

### Rarity Score
- Build frequency distribution database from all users
- Statistical uniqueness calculation (z-scores)
- Comparative analysis vs. genre norms

### Scene Mapping
- Subculture taxonomy (Berlin techno, UK bass, etc.)
- Geographic + temporal context
- Scene signature patterns
