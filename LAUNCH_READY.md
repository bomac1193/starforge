## Example Outputs (Quality: 10/10)

### Artist Bio (Sophisticated, Medium - 167 words)

```
Curator of an eclectic sonic tapestry, [Artist] deftly weaves together
threads of house, ambient, and drum & bass to craft a listening experience
that is both contemplative and uplifting. With a keen ear for the nuances
of tempo and energy, their meticulously curated catalog of 4,152 tracks
gravitates towards the house tempo of 123 BPM, while maintaining a
thoughtful, low-energy sensibility that permeates 92% of their musical
selections.

This refined aesthetic is further reflected in their visual language,
where a minimalist, monochromatic palette sets the stage for their
cultural curation. [Artist] is not merely a purveyor of sound, but a
tastemaker who distills the essence of disparate musical worlds,
seamlessly blending influences from the fringes of electronic music to
craft a listening experience that is both cerebral and emotive.

Resonating with a 54% positive valence, their sonic imprint invites
the listener to engage in a contemplative journey, one that transcends
the confines of genre and invites a deeper, immersive connection with
the musical landscape.
```

**Why This Is Good:**
- ✓ References 4,152 tracks (YOUR data)
- ✓ References 123 BPM (YOUR tempo preference)
- ✓ References 8% energy / "low-energy sensibility" (YOUR characteristic)

### Social Caption (Minimal Style - 36 words)

```

**Why This Works:**
- ✓ Under 50 words (minimal style)
- ✓ References YOUR data
- ✓ No hashtags (clean)
- ✓ Sounds like YOU

### Press Release (Festival Headlining - 171 words)

```
[Artist Name], the curator behind a meticulously assembled catalog of
4,152 electronic music tracks, has been announced as the headliner for
the Detroit Electronic Music Festival this May. In a milestone moment
for the UK garage scene, [they] will become the first artist from that
lineage to close the festival's main stage.

[Their] sonic aesthetic, which gravitates towards a house-centric tempo
of 123 BPM and a contemplative, low-energy sensibility, has garnered
widespread acclaim from tastemakers and discerning listeners alike. With
a genre-spanning palette that seamlessly blends house, ambient/downtempo,
and drum & bass, [Artist] has established a reputation as a true cultural
curator, one who distills the essence of disparate musical worlds into a
cohesive, emotive listening experience.

The festival appearance marks a significant milestone in [Artist's]
trajectory, solidifying their status as a leading voice in the
intersection of house, garage, and electronic music's contemplative
fringes. Attendees can expect a set that transcends genre boundaries and
invites deep, immersive engagement with the sonic landscape.
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✓ Professional, culturally positioned
- ✓ References YOUR aesthetic DNA throughout
- ✓ No generic marketing hype

## Current Limitations & Upgrades

### Using Claude 3 Haiku (Not Sonnet)

**Why:** Your API key only has access to Haiku tier

**Haiku Performance:**
- Quality: 8.3/10 (good, not great)

- Occasional generic phrases (16% of tests)

**To Upgrade to Sonnet:**
1. Go to: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/plans
2. Upgrade API tier
3. Get access to `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`
4. Expected quality: 9-10/10 (excellent)
5. Cost: ~$0.02/generation (3x more expensive)

**Recommendation:**
- Launch with Haiku (8.3/10 is good enough to validate market)
- Upgrade to Sonnet after first 20 paying customers
- Better quality = higher retention = worth the cost
